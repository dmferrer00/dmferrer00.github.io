        <h2> Dynamic Functionality</h2>
        <p> As far as the Java Script Functionality goes it wont really be much, I will have some quality of life features. The hyperlinks will always show on the page, I will also
            make some of the images zoom in on when you hover over them. I want to add a cart feature, where users can add items to their cart and checkout, that will display how many items are in the cart on all pages.
            . I will have a checkout page that will display the total cost of the items in the cart. All of my inspiration comes from <a href = "https://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a>
