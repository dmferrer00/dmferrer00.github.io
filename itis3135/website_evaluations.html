            <a href ="apple.com" target="_blank"><h3>Apple</h3></a>
            <p>
                Apple is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California. It designs, develops, and launches
                personal computers, tablets, wearables, and services.

            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: Apple uses high contrast between product images and simple backgrounds, making products the clear focal point, like on the iPhone or MacBook pages​</li>
                <li>Repetition: The navigation bar, fonts, and color palette are consistently used across all pages, reinforcing a cohesive brand identity​</li>
                <li>Alignment: Apple’s website adheres to clean grid-based layouts, aligning text and images precisely to maintain a structured and organized look​</li>    
                <li>Proximity: Related elements, such as product descriptions and purchase options, are grouped together, with ample whitespace separating unrelated sections for clarity</li>
            </ul>
            <a href ="craigslist.com" target="_blank"><h3>Craigslist</h3></a>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: Craigslist uses minimal visual contrast, relying on basic black text on a white background and blue links, which keeps the design functional but plain.</li>
                <li>Repetition: The layout and font choices remain consistent across the entire site, with uniform lists and link styles providing a familiar user experience.</li>
                <li>Alignment: Text and listings are left-aligned, giving the site a straightforward, no-frills structure that is easy to follow.</li>
                <li>Proximity: Items within each category are grouped closely together, but the site's simple layout sometimes makes it difficult to distinguish between sections quickly.</li>
            </ul>
